		<p><b>Kabaddi</b> is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of <strong>seven</strong> players. The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a <mark>"raider",</mark> to run into the opposing team's half of the court, <i>touch</i> out as many of their players and <del>return </del>to their own half of the <ins>court,</ins> all without being tackled by the defenders in <q>30 seconds</q>. Points are scored for each player tagged by the<small> raider,</small> while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.H<sub>2</sub>O and<sup>NH4</sup></P>
